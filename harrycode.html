     The requirements of these programmes are described in terms of the total number of units which a student must complete rather than the duration.

    <p class="sectionssubtag text-small">
        Most students may be able to complete such a programme in four semesters, wherein the last semester may be spent for either of the two available alternatives, namely, Dissertation and Practice School. Motivated students who opt for the dissertation stream may finish the programme in three semesters by starting work on the dissertation component in their first semester itself. The programmes are intended to give a immersive professional experience and an opportunity to acquire further competence either in one's own discipline or gain complementary knowledge in many other traditional areas of Engineering, Pharmacy as well as interdisciplinary areas, like, Electronics and Control, Embedded Systems, Microelectronics, Software Systems, Biotechnology, Manufacturing Systems, Design Engineering, Materials Science & Technology, Transportation Engineering, Public Health (M.Phil in Public Health) etc.
